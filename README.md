# DuckBot

## Running

Add the Discord bot token in the `.env` file.

```
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

Make sure you have the dependencies installed as well. They are listed in `requirements.txt`. Copy `example.config.json` and rename to `config.json`. Edit the values in the config file accordingly.

The entry point of the bot is `main.py`.
